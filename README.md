# Upgrading Amenities: An Application of Recommender Systems in Airbnb Listings
##### Big Data and Cloud Computing project by Justine Bu&ntilde;o, Elijah Justin Medina & Raphael Mari Ongleo

This study aims to find which amenities should owners/hosts need to add to their Airbnb properties to become more competitive in their different segments. Using the Inside Airbnb dataset filtered to listings only, we performed clustering of the different listings based on the different features such as number of bedrooms, property type, etc. and built a recommender system that prescribes amenities that are most needed to increase the value of the property per cluster.

##### Data

The data used in this analysis is from Inside Airbnb. The data consists of listings from 2015 to 2019 amounting to about 16 million rows with 106 features, comprising a total of 85GB. Due to the size of the data, it is not included in the repository.

##### Report and analysis

The full report is included in the Jupyter notebook. If you have any questions regarding this study, please send me a message via <a href="mailto:elijahjustinmedina@gmail.com">e-mail</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elijah-justin-medina/">LinkedIn</a>.
